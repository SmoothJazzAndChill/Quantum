This project is my attempt at building a game engine as a learning experience using the Vulkan Graphics API

I don't use git as my primary source control as I have a private Perforce server setup on AWS so most of the commits will just be 
file uploads. Still a work in progress and as I don't use git it's not entirely up to date
